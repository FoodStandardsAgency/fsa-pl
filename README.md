A tile design friendly pattern library with a simple responsive grid inspired by BBCâ€™s GEL consisting of 16px columns.

## How to install and run

1. Clone this repo onto your machine.
2. Install [Node][node], [NPM][npm] and [Python][python].
3. Run `npm install` from the root of the repo you've cloned onto your machine.
4. Use the JS and CSS files in the `dist` directory.

Optional (for local development of the pattern library):
* New JS files go into the `js` directory and the path added into the config object in the package.json. You'll need to restart `npm run watch` afterwards.
* New SCSS files should be added to the `scss` directory. Add the path into `main.scss` and `old-ie.scss`.
